okay so here's something exciting – **masks of the void**, a super trippy roguelite action-rpg from **rolldbox games**, is officially landing on **somnia**. i've been keeping an eye on this one, and now with the support of **uprising labs**, it’s making its way into the on-chain world, which honestly feels like the perfect fit.

in this game, you play as **iret**, a girl with strange powers who’s trying to survive the **neverending night** – and yeah, the whole vibe is surreal and a bit chaotic in the best way.

## real-time chaos meets on-chain speed

let’s talk tech for a sec. what makes this launch extra special is that **masks of the void** is built on **somnia**, which means we’re talking **1M transactions per second**, **sub-second finality**, and **sub-cent gas fees**. this isn’t some turn-based blockchain sim – this is full-on real-time action with on-chain everything. performance? check. scale? double check.

## telekinesis, masks, and roguelite weirdness

gameplay-wise, it’s a trip. you can use **telekinetic powers** to throw stuff around – debris, walls, you name it. every playthrough is different, and every choice you make changes how the world reacts. the more power you gain, the more the world gets unstable. enemies mutate. reality bends. it’s wild.

there are **three main playstyles**, but the real magic is in the **randomized upgrades and object builds**. you’ll never have the same run twice, and if you’re like me and love experimenting with chaos, this is your playground.

## no downloads. no friction. just play.

the game’s launching on the **somnia testnet** **very soon**, and guess what? you’ll be able to play it straight from your browser with **webgl**. no installs, no launcher drama – just click and go. and if you’re competitive, there’ll be **leaderboards**, **pve missions**, and **real rewards** waiting.

everything you do – from logging in to looting, fighting, or dying – gets recorded **on-chain** via **uprising labs' gamers l.a.b.**, which is honestly setting a new bar for how games track and reward player actions.

## rewards? yeah, there’s a bunch

you can earn stuff like:

- **nfts**
- **game passes**
- **steam keys**
- **whitelist spots**
- **ecosystem tokens**

and those rewards won’t just live in one game – they’ll be usable across **uprising labs**, the **dream catalyst** ecosystem, and other projects on somnia.

## somnia's infrastructure makes this all possible

building web3 games used to be a pain – expensive, slow, and hard to scale. but somnia? it's rewriting the rulebook. their **multi-stream consensus** tech means devs don’t have to compromise anymore. gas fees are super low, latency is basically nonexistent, and performance is on par (or better) than what you’d expect from traditional platforms.

plus, somnia isn’t just about speed. it lets devs build **real economies**, create **interoperable assets**, and even go wild with ideas like **prediction markets**, **streamer challenges**, and more. i’m all in for that kind of experimentation.

## other games to watch on somnia

if you haven’t checked out the rest of somnia’s lineup, here are some gems:

- **maulstrom** – naval combat with dark fantasy energy  
- **mullet cop: mall sim** – chaos in a retro-futurist mall, complete with violence sliders  
- **netherak demons** – brutal rpg action with an economy powered by pain (literally)  
- **dark table ccg** – strategic card game without the lootbox BS  

and with **masks of the void** joining the mix, somnia's gameverse is leveling up fast. this is just the beginning.

## stay in the loop

Devs from all these games drop in to talk about what they’re building, and yeah – sometimes there’s some juicy alpha. worth tuning in.

if you haven’t already, go visit [somnia.network](https://somnia.network), jump into the discord, and maybe even apply for the **dream catalyst accelerator** if you’re working on your own project.

i’m hyped for what’s coming. **masks of the void** looks sick, the tech is solid, and somnia’s just getting warmed up. let’s see how deep this rabbit hole goes.
