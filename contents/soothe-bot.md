## Requirements

1. Get bot token as shown [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot).
   1.1 Enable "Message Content Intent" in Discord Developer Portal
2. Node.js 16 or newer

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repo, install packages & build the bot

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soothe-bot/soothe.git
cd soothe
npm install
npm run build
```

2. Create a file named `.env` and insert following content in it:

```txt
TOKEN="paste your token here"
```

3. Run the bot

```bash
npm start
```

## üêã Running with docker

To run this bot using docker you'll have to set an env variable `TOKEN` to the token of your discord bot and mount a volume to `/app/data`. Here is a simple example:

```
docker run -e TOKEN=*your bot token here* -v ./data:/app/data --name soothe -d lrmn/soothe
```

You can also use docker compose

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  bot:
    restart: always
    image: lrmn/soothe
    environment:
      - TOKEN=*your bot token here*
    volumes:
      - soothedata:/app/data

volumes:
  soothedata:
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional settings

Every setting described here is an env variable and should be put inside of your `.env` file.

- `DEF_PREFIX`: this variable defines the default prefix for non-slash commands. It can be overwritten by using the [`prefix`](#managment) command. By default it is set to `s`
