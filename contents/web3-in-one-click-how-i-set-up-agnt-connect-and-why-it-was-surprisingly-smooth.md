Let’s be real — most of us have a love-hate relationship with Web3 onboarding.

You hear about a cool new tool. Everyone’s hyped. You check it out… and 10 minutes later, you're buried under five tabs, three wallets, a bridge tutorial, and a growing sense of _“maybe later.”_

So when I first came across **AGNT Connect**, I had that same hesitation.

But turns out — this one actually made things _easier_. Like, **refreshingly easier**.

If you’ve been curious but haven’t taken the leap yet, here’s how I set it up — step-by-step, no fluff, no tech headaches.

## 🚀 Step 1: Install AGNT Connect on Chrome

First things first — head over to the [Chrome Web Store](https://go.agnthub.ai/connect).

Click **"Add to Chrome"**, approve the install, and within seconds, the AGNT Connect icon will pop up next to your address bar.

> 💡 **Pro tip**: If you're in Incognito or Guest mode, switch to a regular Chrome window. Extensions won't install otherwise.

---

## ✨ Step 2: Quick Onboarding (Or Skip It — Your Call)

Once installed, it walks you through a simple intro. You’ll get a glimpse of what’s inside — wallet features, analytics, token actions, and AI-powered agents.

Not in the mood? You can skip onboarding and come back to it later. Everything’s still there when you're ready.

## 🔐 Step 3: Log in Securely with X (Twitter)

This part surprised me: **you don’t need to manually set up a wallet**.

Just authorize via X (Twitter), and AGNT Connect handles the rest:

- ✅ If you're new: it creates a secure wallet for you.
- 🔁 Already have one? It restores your existing one.

It’s powered by **Privy**, which means **your private keys are never stored** by AGNT. You stay in full control.

---

## 🧭 Step 4: Welcome to Your Web3 Command Center

Once you’re in, everything's laid out super clean:

- **Wallet Tab** → See your assets and balances.
- **Analytics Tab** → Dive into token data, project insights, and interact with AI agents — right from inside X.
- **Apps Tab** → Browse Web3 projects, discover key profiles, and stay updated without switching platforms.

> 💡 Some features unlock when you're on a project’s page on X that has integrated tokens or agents.

## 🪙 AGNT Points (Because Rewards Are Always Fun)

At the bottom of the extension, you’ll see your **AGNT Points**. These build up from interactions and help you level up in the AGNT ecosystem.

## Final Thoughts

AGNT Connect doesn’t feel like _“just another extension.”_ It actually makes Web3 feel a little more… **human**.

Fewer clicks. No weird bridge detours. Just useful tools — right where you’re already spending time.
