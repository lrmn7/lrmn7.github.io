title: Qr code generator simple
description: >-
  After trying to create a nice qr code with a logo for my work I quickly became frustrated by how limited most tools online were and how they all wanted me to signup and added bloat to the process. So I decided to create my own tool that would be simple, easy, feature rich and free to use.😎
