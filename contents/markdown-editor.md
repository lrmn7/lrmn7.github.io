# Markdown-Editor

This is a simple live markdown editor, build with React (Vite) and Chakra UI.

Actually, I made it for myself. But of course I'm open to any feedbacks. You can fork or clone this repo and make a PR here if you have some idea.

## What I'm use here?

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) as build tool.
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started) as UI Library.
- [React Markdown Preview](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-markdown-preview) to make the markdown preview result.
- [React TextArea Editor](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-textarea-code-editor) as the text editor component.

## How to use it?

- Open [markdown-editor.is-a.fun](https://markdown-editor.is-a.fun)
- You can input your markdown text at the textarea input, and the preview will be displayed live.
- Here's [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) to help you write the markdown text.
